Metwit Weather Widget displays real time local weather conditions on your personal blog. It can be positioned on the sidebar or elsewhere.

== Description ==

Metwit Weather Widget is a weather plugin that displays local weather on your blog at a location of your choice. Unlike other weather widgets, Metwit's information relies on an array of sources, from both professional service providers and crowd sourced weather reports, and determines the most accurate weather information thanks to an exclusive algorithm.

* Integrated reverse geocoding (displays location at a given coordinate pairing)
* Displays temperature and humidity
* Displays either Celsius or Fahrenheit temperatures
* Uses Metwit's renowned icons in an animated .svg format
